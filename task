### React Photo Gallery Assignment

*Objective:*
Build a responsive photo gallery using React that fetches images from an API and allows users to interact with the images.

*Requirements:*

1. *Fetch Images:*
   - Fetch a list of images from the Unsplash API or any other image API of your choice.

2. *Display Images:*
   - Display the fetched images in a responsive grid layout.
   - Ensure that the images are lazy-loaded for better performance.

3. *Image Modal:*
   - Implement a feature where users can click on an image to open a modal.
   - The modal should display the selected image with additional details such as the photographer's name and a description (if available).

4. *Search Functionality:*
   - Implement a search bar that allows users to filter images based on keywords.
   - When a user enters a search term, update the gallery to display only the matching images.

5. *Responsive Design:*
   - Ensure that the gallery is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

6. *Loading Indicator:*
   - Display a loading indicator while the images are being fetched.

*Constraints:*

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Use state management to handle the application state.
- You can use CSS for styling, but prioritize functionality.

*Bonus:*

- Implement pagination to load more images as the user scrolls.
- Add animation effects for a smoother user experience.
- Implement error handling for failed API requests.
- Write unit tests for critical components.

*Submission:*

- Create a GitHub repository for the project.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application locally.
- Add comments to explain complex parts of the code.
